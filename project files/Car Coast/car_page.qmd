## Project Overview
Using data from a 2016 Aston Martin DB9 coasting both up and down hill, we built a Python script that was able to estimate a coefficient of drag as well as the coefficient of static friction that was acting on the car. We also calculated how much power would be required to maintain different constant speeds given the same conditions.

## The Process
To analyze the motion of a car coasting both uphill and downhill on an inclined plane, we began by constructing free-body diagrams for each scenario. These diagrams account for the force of gravity, the normal force, aerodynamic drag ($F_d$), and rolling friction ($F_r$). Using the free-body and corresponding kinetic diagrams, we derived the equations of motion by applying Newton’s second law in the direction of motion.

After deriving the necessary equations, we took the second order differential equation and split it into two first order differential equations, allowing us to use Python's ODE solver. We then created a function that would take our data and find the percent error of the function by comparing it to the experimental data. This allowed us to create confindence intervals as a way of estimating uncertainty. Finally we took what we had learned, and used that in order to find the power necessary to maintain a certain constant velocity. 


## Results
The best-fit parameters that matched the experimental data were **$C_d = 0.3283$** and **$k = 0.0170$**. Using these values, the modeled curves closely aligned with the measured data, as shown in the velocity-time comparison.

## Discussion
The coefficient of drag $C_d$ primarily influences vehicle deceleration at higher speeds due to its quadratic relationship with velocity, making it more dominant during the early phase of coast-down. In contrast, the rolling friction coefficient $k$ exerts a near-constant effect and is more significant at lower speeds.

Because of this, the effects of $C_d$ and $k$ can be distinguished by examining how quickly velocity drops early in the coast versus how it behaves near the end. However, there is still some flexibility—it is possible to slightly increase one parameter while decreasing the other and still achieve a visually similar fit. This limits the precision with which either parameter can be determined individually, a trade-off we quantified through our confidence interval analysis.
