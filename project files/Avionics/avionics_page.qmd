## Project Overview
While working at a materials testing lab in Lockheed Martin, I was put in charge of a project testing the effects of different anodizing processes on corrosion rate of avionics connectors.

This was done by taking avionics connectors and treating them with different anodizing processes. These were then put in fog testing chambers, one with salt fog and one with SO$_2$ fog, and then taken out. Electrical conductivity was tested and used to measure corrosion. I then took all of this information and put it into a techincal internal report.
